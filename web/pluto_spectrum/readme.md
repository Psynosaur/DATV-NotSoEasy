The `drawFFT` method is used to draw an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) spectrum visualization based on provided `bins` of data.

## drawFFT function breakdown

1. It starts a path for drawing on a canvas context that represents the FFT spectrum diagram using the `this.ctx.beginPath()` method call.
2. It sets the initial move to a position of `-1` in the x-coordinate and `this.spectrumHeight + 1` in the y-coordinate.
3. Then, it uses a loop to go through each individual bin. In this context, a bin is a segment of the spectrum array with a particular magnitude and frequency.
4. For each bin, it calculates the y-value, which represents the height of a bar (or line) in the spectrum diagram â€” higher bars correspond to higher magnitudes in that spectrum segment.
5. If the y-value is more than the spectrumHeight, it is reset to `this.spectrumHeight + 1` to avoid overflow. Similarly, if the y-value is less than `0`, it's reset to `0` to avoid underflow.
6. After processing each bin's data, a line is drawn from the previous point to the current bin's point with `this.ctx.lineTo(i, y)`.
7. At the end, the path is closed by a line to `this.wf_size + 1, this.spectrumHeight + 1`.
8. Then, the stroke style of your context is set to color "#fefefe" and the path is drawn using `this.ctx.stroke()`.

The `Spectrum` instance has a context, `this.ctx`, which is a reference to a canvas context used for drawing. It also has a `this.spectrumHeight` property and a method `this.squeeze`, which are used for computations in the `drawFFT` method. These provide important context but their detailed function isn't available from the provided code.

The `Spectrum` instances have additional attributes such as `fps`, `gain`, and `spanHz`, which might be configurable settings for the FFT visualization. For example, `fps` is likely "frames per second", `gain` could be a multiplication factor for the bin magnitudes, and `spanHz` could be the total frequency span covered by the FFT.

The `on_canvas_click` method is an event handler function that executes when the canvas is clicked.

The `setAveraging`, `updateSpectrumRatio`, `doAutoScale`, and `resize` functions seem to be related to various settings/parameters for the visualization, such as min/max dB, threshold, scales, dimensions and more.

The `detect_signals` and `draw_signal_threshold` functions are used to determine and indicate the presence of significant signals in the FFT spectrum.

The `setRxClickState` function is setting up a click state for "Rx".

It's accepting two parameters and is scaling the width of a box based on those parameters and saves it into `localStorage` (if available).

## detect_signals function breakdown

1.  The `detect_signals` function is used to find and mark signal parts from a faster Fourier transform (FFT) data in a spectrum or waterfall graph.
2.  The function accepts five parameters: `fft_data` (an array representing the FFT data), `ctx` (the context from a Canvas where the waterfall is drawn), `canvasHeight` and `canvasWidth` (dimensions of the Canvas), and `sr` (sample rate).
3.  Several local variables are defined, serving specific purposes in the algorithm that follows.
4.  For each bin in the FFT data array, the function determines whether it is part of a signal based on calculated thresholds, thus marking its start and end in the array.
5.  A boolean flag `in_signal` is initiated that checks whether we are in the signal's range. If the FFT data at a particular index exceeds the defined threshold, `in_signal` becomes true. Otherwise, it's set to false.
6.  If `in_signal` is true, the function searches for the end of the signal, keeping track of where the FFT data points sink below the threshold, and labels that point as the end of the signal.
7.  Once the start and end of the signal are determined, various properties of the signal, such as strength, bandwidth, and frequency, are calculated.
8.  These properties, along with the start and end point of the signal, are stored in an object and added into the `signals` array for later use.
9.  Under certain conditions, information about detected signals is drawn on the canvas.


## drawSpectrum function breakdown


The code defines a method `drawSpectrum` of the `Spectrum` object in ECMAScript 6. This object appears to be representing a Spectrum analyzer that provides various manipulation and visualization for signal processing.

Below is an explanation of different parts of the function:

- It initializes the width and height variables according to `this.ctx.canvas.width` and `this.ctx.canvas.height` respectively.
- It fills the entire spectrum box with black color using `fillRect`.
- A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) averaging is being done if `this.averaging > 0`. If previous average bins do not exist (or if the number of bins has changed), it creates new average bins by copying `bins`. Otherwise, it computes exponentially-weighted moving average for each bin.
- If `this.maxHold` is `true`, it computes the maximum value for each bin. If the current value of the bin is greater than the previous maximum, it updates the maximum. Otherwise, it increases the previous maximum slightly (decay).
- It makes sure not to draw anything if the spectrum is not visible.
- Saves the current state of the canvas using `ctx.save()`, and scales the rendering context according to `width / this.wf_size`, `1`.
- Draw maximal hold values using `drawFFT` if `maxHold` is `true`.
- If `autoScale` is `true`, the function performs auto scaling using `doAutoScale`.
- Draws FFT bins using `drawFFT`.
- Restores the original state of the canvas before scaling by using `ctx.restore()`.
- Fills the scaled path with canvas gradient.
- Detects the signals by calling `detect_signals` function.
- Copies axes from offscreen canvas.

Additional information about defined variables and functions used:

- `ctx`: a 2D rendering context for the HTML `<canvas>` element.
- `averaging`: appears to be an option that specifies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) averaging.
- `alpha`: factor for exponential moving average in spectrum smoothing.
- `ctx_axes`: offscreen canvas for drawing axis.
- `width` and `height`: dimensions of the canvas element.
- `wf_size`: width of waterfall display.
- Various functions like `drawFFT`, `doAutoScale`, `draw_signal_threshold` and `detect_signals` are part of the `Spectrum` object and are used for manipulating and visualizing the spectrum data. They are not defined in the provided code and their details would be defined elsewhere in the codebase.
- `spanHz`: likely the frequency span of the spectrum.
- `detect_signals`: Function to detect signals in the given frequency bins. The specifics would be implemented elsewhere in the codebase.
- The `Spectrum` function seems to be a constructor function for creating instances of Spectrum, which holds many properties related to the spectrum analyzer and has methods that allow interaction with the canvas and signal data.

This should give you an overview of what `Spectrum.prototype.drawSpectrum` function is doing. It appears to be a complex function for drawing a spectrum (possibly audio or radio signal data) and includes features like FFT bin averaging, maximum hold display, auto scaling, detection of signals, and offscreen canvas usage for efficiency. However, without further code context, like the implementation of `drawFFT`, `doAutoScale`, `draw_signal_threshold` and `detect_signals` functions and actual usage, the exact purpose and functionality would be difficult to determine.
