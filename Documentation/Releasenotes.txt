-Better audio-codec, sounds much better now at low SR`s and is now adjustable in global configuration
-Parameters adjusted, H.264/H.265/H.266 more stable @ higher SR`s and cutting szenes, tested up to 1000KS FEC 1/2, no drops anymore
-No need to switch on REMUX (DVB-Comp.) for H.264/H.265 @ high SR`s on Pluto anymore, stream is now ok
-2nd script to start MPV-Player
-Service-ID/Program/Provider adjusted, now correct displayed
-New versions of ffplay and ffmpeg

0.9

-Added AC3 audio
-Implementation of 8PSK and 16APSK, more flexible
-Implementation of lower SR`s

0.91
-Bugfixes
-Parameters adjusted

0.92
-DATV-NotSoEasy now accepts streams via network (UDP,RTMP), stream input can be defined in config.ini
-DATV-NotSoEasy now can directly play from files (mp3, mp4, and many more)
-Implemented 3 profiles for fast start (start SET-FAVORITE.bat to edit the profiles).
-Improved stability for H.266
-PTT function, press Pause/Break to stop streaming, press enter to resume. This toggles TX ON/OFF. Be shure to focus the window of DATV-NotSoEasy.
-Changed the default video device to "OBS Virtual Camera", this works with OBS 28 and higher, for OBS 27 with VC plugin try "OBS-Camera"
-Increased quality, stability and performance at higher FPS, tested up to 60FPS
-Adjusted selectable FPS to match OBS FPS, this minimizes the effect of duplicate frames and drops. Best is to set FPS in OBS to match selected FPS in DATV-NotSoEasy.
 This is not mandatory but it works best.
-Modified settings for 35KS
-Updated documentation with screenshots, now in a seperate "Documentation" folder

-Hint: Always quit DATV-NotSoEasy by pressing "q", not only close the window. Otherwhise depending windows will not be closed automatically.
-Hint: When you enable "FW=yes" you must use the brand new F5OEO FW !!! This FW is available on request, just ask Evariste F5OEO !!! Set "FW=no" with all other FW versions !!!
-Added a light version (DATV-TX-LIGHT.bat), just steering the Pluto without streaming. Can be done by OBS direct or something similar.
-Parameters adjusted, videobitrate now possible down to 20kbit.
-Parameters adjusted, better performance now at SR`s > 1500KS.
-SR now up to 4000KS (makes only sense with new F5OEO FW and terrestical).
-Bugfixes and improvement for scripts under \scripts (thanks for the hint Jacinto).

-Added Longmynd switch in config-tx.ini (STARTLONGMYND=on) to switch on GSE RX in the Pluto. You need to connect a Minitiouner via USB-HUB to the Pluto.

-Manual input for RX-frequency added (Longmynd), input in kHz
-3 Profiles for DATV-TX-LIGHT.bat added.
-Profile editor for DATV-TX-LIGHT added.
-Profile editors now also supporting free frequency input.
-Longmynd RX is now controlled by DATV-NotSoEasy properly, you can also change the RX frequency and RX sample rate and on the fly.
-RX and TX frequency in GSE-Mode can be steered independently even during operation (TX-Frequency window). Watch the result in the MQTT-Browser.
-Sample Rate in GSE-Mode can be steered independently even during operation (TX-Frequency window). Watch the result in the MQTT-Browser.
